### Practical sessions

* Tutored Project: Begins in the second week with data identification and bioinformatics strategy definition, followed by workflow design, data analysis, and a final oral presentation.
* One-Month Internship: Following the 4-week course, each student completes a supervised immersion internship supervised by two teaching tutors and a researcher from the host laboratory.

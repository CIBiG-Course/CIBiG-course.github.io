## Learning objectives

The Learning objectives of this training include acquiring the fundamental principles of bioinformatics, understanding sequencing techniques and their application, as well as using bioinformatics tools to automate the collection and management of sequencing data. Additionally, it aims to develop practical skills in the analysis and interpretation of these data.

The certificate offers a multidisciplinary training, covering technical and scientific skills such as advanced use of computing clusters, programming, genome sequencing, data reproducibility/open science, and specialization in specific domains of bioinformatics.

* Gain an in-depth understanding of the fundamental concepts of bioinformatics.
* Develop practical skills in the analysis of sequencing data.
* Apply bioinformatics to the specific challenges of agriculture and health in West Africa.
* Master the use of Linux and (bio)informatics tools to carry out own bioinformatics projects independently.
* Collaborate on practical projects for direct application of acquired skills.
* Communicate orally and in writing for training and knowledge transfer purposes.
* Integrate the principles of open science and reproducibility into the tools and analyses implemented.

## Program

### 12 hours of distance learning
* Online courses covering plant biology, genomics and functional genomics taught by national and international lecturers to ensure a solid understanding of key concepts.

### 153 hours of face-to-face teaching

8 teaching modules:
* “Sequencing: from library preparation to sequencing” - 30h
* Biological databases - 8h
* Linux - 32h
* Python programming - 28h
* Data analysis and visualization in R - 12h
* Omics data analysis (19h) & group tutored project - 34h
* Reproducibility - 12h 
* One-month internship

### Internships/Tutored projects

A large part of the curriculum is devoted to practical work, projects and internships.
The tutored project, which starts in the second week of the course, involves identifying the data to be analyzed and defining the bioinformatics strategy. It continues during weeks 3 and 4 with group work to design workflows and analyze data. It ends with an oral presentation of the project.
At the end of the 4-week course, each student will complete a one-month immersion internship, supervised by a pair of North/South teaching tutors and a scientific supervisor from the host laboratory.

The certificate provides multidisciplinary training in advancing computing, programming, genome sequencing, data reproducibility, open science, and specific bioinformatics thematics.

* Understanding fundamental bioinformatics concepts 
* Develop practical skills in sequencing genome and analysis of sequencing data.
* Apply bioinformatics to Agricultural and Health challenges in West Africa.
* Master Linux and (bio)informatics tools to carry out your own research projects.
* Collaborate on practical projects to apply learned skills.
* Communicate orally and in writing for training and knowledge transfer purposes.
* Integrate open science and reproducibility principles.

## Program structure

### 12 hours of distance learning
* Online courses in plant biology, genomics to ensure a solid understanding of key concept.

### 153 hours of face-to-face teaching

8 modules:
* Sequencing: from library preparation to sequencing - 30h
* Biological databases - 8h
* Linux - 32h
* Python programming - 28h
* Data analysis and visualization in R - 12h

### Internships/Tutored projects

* Tutored Project: Begins in the second week with data identification and bioinformatics strategy definition, followed by workflow design, data analysis, and a final oral presentation.
* One-Month Internship: Following the 4-week course, each student completes a supervised immersion internship with guidance from North/South teaching tutors and a host laboratory scientific supervisor.
